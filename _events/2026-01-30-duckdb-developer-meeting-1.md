We are excited to announce the first DuckDB Developer Meeting, organized by [DuckDB Labs](https://duckdblabs.com/).
The event will feature talks from DuckDB developers, and is aimed at developers who build DuckDB extensions or complex applications on top of DuckDB.

### New Event Type

This event is slightly different from our usual meetups and conferences as it primarily focuses on DuckDB extension development and building complex applications on top of DuckDB. Therefore, the main topics of the event will be the **C API, extension template, and internals**.

### Registration Process

Attendance is free. Please [RSVP on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/duckdb-developer-meeting-1-tickets-1850334944629?aff=oddtdtcreator).
