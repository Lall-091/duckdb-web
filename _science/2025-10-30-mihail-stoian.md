## Description

In this episode of the DuckDB in Research series, host **Jack Waudby** sits down with **Mihail Stoian,** PhD student at the Data **Systems Lab, University of Technology Nuremberg,** to unpack the cutting-edge ideas behind **Parachute,** a new approach to robust query processing and bidirectional information passing in modern analytical databases.
We explore how Parachute **bridges theory and practice,** combining concepts from instance-optimal algorithms and semi-join filtering to boost performance in **DuckDB,** the in-process analytical SQL engine that’s reshaping how research meets real-world data systems.

Mihail discusses:

* How _Parachute_ extends semi-join filtering for two-way information flow
* The challenges of implementing research ideas inside DuckDB
* Practical performance gains on TPC-H and CEB workloads
* The future of adaptive query processing and research-driven system design

Whether you’re a **database researcher,** **systems engineer,** or **curious practitioner,** this deep-dive reveals how academic innovation continues to shape modern data infrastructure.
