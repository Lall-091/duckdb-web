## Description

In this episode of the _DuckDB in Research_ series, host Dr Jack Waudby talks with **Professor Torsten Grust** from the University of Tübingen. Torsten is one of the pioneers behind DuckDB’s implementation of recursive CTEs.

In the episode they unpack:

* The power of **recursive CTEs** and how they turn SQL into a full-fledged programming language.
* The story behind **adding recursion to DuckDB,** including the using key feature and the _trampoline_ and _TTL_ extensions emerging from Torsten’s lab.
* How these ideas are transforming research, teaching, and even DuckDB’s internal architecture.
* Why **DuckDB makes databases exciting again** — from classroom to cutting-edge systems research.

If you’re into **data systems, query processing, or bridging research and practice,** this episode is for you.
